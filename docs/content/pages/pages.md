# Pages

Pages are the actual content the user sees. The page you're currently looking at is
a [markdown page](https://github.com/Bwc9876/menagerie/blob/master/docs/content/pages/pages.md?plain=1){target='_blank'}.

## Adding Pages

To create new pages, simply add them to the `pages` folder in `content`.  
Menagerie will look for the following file extensions to generate from:

```diff
+ *.md -> Markdown
+ *.jinja2, *.html, *.htm -> HTML
+ *.json, *.jsonc -> JSON Schema
+ *.xsd, *.xml -> XML Schema
+ *.yaml, *.yml -> YAML Schema
```

### A Note About Home

When menagerie encounters a page titled 'home', special behaviour occurs:

- The title of the page is set to *just* the app name, and the "Home -" is omitted
- The navbar icons and app name will lead to that page when clicked

You want to set `Out_File` to `index` on this page so your webserver knows to use this page as the landing document.

## Page Metadata

Page metadata is data included in the file that tells menagerie how to generate a corresponding HTML document.  
The way to describe metadata is different depending on what language you're using

### Markdown Metadata

Uses the standard markdown metadata format, create a block at the very top of your document that looks like this:

```md
---
Title: My Page
Sort_Priority: 100
---

# Welcome to my cool page!
...
```

### HTML Metadata

Uses **jinja** comments (`{{ '{#' }} {{ '#}' }}`), create comments near the top of the file that look like this (note
the `~` characters):

```text
{{ '{#~' }} Title: My Page {{ '~#}' }}
{{ '{#~' }} Sort-Priority: {{ '~#}' }}
```

### JSON Schema Metadata

Create a top-level key named `$docs`. Then simply put in keys:

```json
{
    "$docs": {
        "title": "My Page",
        "sort_priority": 100
    }
}
```

### YAML Schema Metadata

Create a top-level dictionary named `$docs`. Then simply put in the keys:

```yaml
$docs:
  title: My Schema
  description: My really cool schema
  sort_priority: 100
```

### XML Schema Metadata

Uses xml comments; create comments near the top of the file that look like this (note the `~` characters)

```xml
<!--~ Title:My Page ~-->
<!--~ Sort_Priority:100 ~-->
<Myelement>Text</Myelement>
<!-- ... -->
```

## Metadata Reference

**Note:** These are all case-insensitive

{% set secret_link='Hidden Page'|route %}

| **Name**          | **Description**                                                                                                                                                           | **Default**                                  |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Title**         | The title of this page, displayed in many places and used in metadata. Also what you pass to `route`.  This is case-insensitive so make sure not to make duplicate titles | Derives from filename if nothing is provided |
| **Description**   | The description of this page, appears in social media embeds and metadata                                                                                                 | Description specified in `config.json`       |
| **Sort_Priority** | How much to prioritize this page in the navbar, should be from 0-100.                                                                                                     | 30                                           |
| **Render_TOC**    | Whether to render a table of contents on this page (HTML/MD Pages only)                                                                                                   | True                                         |
| **Out_File**      | Name of output file, omit the file extension                                                                                                                              | Same as name of source file                  |
| **Hide_In_Nav**   | Whether to hide this page in the navbar (this site [has a hidden page]({{ secret_link }}))                                                                                | False                                        |

## Linking to Pages

You can link to other pages in markdown and html pages by using the `route` filter and passing in the title of the page

```html
<a href="{{ '{{' }} 'my page'|route {{ '}}' }}">Check out my cool page!</a>
```

```md
[Check out my cool page!]({{ '{{' }} 'my page'|route {{ '}}' }})
```

### Referencing Schema Properties

When you want to link to specific schemas properties, you can use the normal `route` filter and append the path of the property after a hashtag.

```md
[Link to my schema property]({{ '{{' }} "My Schema"|route {{ '}}' }}#my-property)
```

If you don't know the path of the property, go to the page for the schema and click on it; The path should then appear in your URL bar after the `#` character.

## Table of Contents

A table of contents is automatically generated for HTML and Markdown pages.  
This can be disabled with the `render_toc` metadata attribute.

### In Markdown

In markdown all headings are put into the table of contents

### In HTML

In HTML all headings **with an id** are put into the table of contents

## Images

Images are [static files]({{ "static files"|route }}), in order to get the path to put in the src attribute, you can use
the `static` filter. Pass in the path of the files relative to the `static` folder in `content`.

```html
<img alt="My cool image" src="{{ '{{' }} 'images/my_image.png'|static {{ '}}' }}"/>
```

```md
![My cool image]({{ '{{' }} 'images/my_image.png'|static {{ '}}' }})
```

## Adding Styles to Pages

You can use the `styles` config option to set a global CSS file to apply to all pages, just pass in the path relative to
the `static` folder.

```json
{
    "styles": {
        "base": "styles/my_base_styles.css",
        "schema": "styles/my_schema_styles.css"
    }
}
```

You can also specify one for schemas only.

## Admonitions

Menagerie also provides a way to make admonitions, which look like this:
!!! alert-danger "Admonition Title"
    Admonition Body Text

To create admonitions, use this syntax:

```md
!!! alert-info "Title"
    Admonition Body Text
```

You can replace the `info` with [any valid bootstrap alert type](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/alerts/#examples). Or you could use your own if you're compiling your own alert variants in SASS.

## Grouping Pages

To create groups of pages (dropdowns in the navbar), create folders in the `pages` folder. For example if I want a
dropdown for all of my schemas I might lay out my `pages` folder like so:

```text
- index.md
- schemas/
    - my_schema.json
    - my_other_schema.xsd
```

This will create a dropdown named "Schemas" on the navbar.

### Group Metadata

Groups can also have metadata. To specify it, create a file called `_folder.json` in the folder. Then fill this out with
the metadata. Groups only allow for `title` and `sort_priority` to be set.

## Minification

All rendered pages are minified to save on space and network load (this can be disabled in `config.json`).

## Built-In Filters & Globals Reference

In addition to [all the built-in jinja filters](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.1.x/templates/#builtin-filters), menagerie provides some more:

| **Name**    | **Description**                                                                               |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `route`     | Route a page title to the output file path                                                    |
| `static`    | Get a static file's path, replacing file extensions if necessary                              |
| `full_url`  | Get the full URL of a file                                                                    |
| `simple_md` | Render markdown in the string to HTML (Probably wanna pass the output of this through `safe`) |

Also, you have access to the `settings` dictionary, which holds all options from your `config.json` and some more.  
To view these properties, look at [Settings.py](https://github.com/Bwc9876/menagerie/blob/master/menagerie/Settings.py) in the source code.

### Extra Settings

Using the `extras` key in settings allows you to define additional options to insert into pages.  
{{ settings['extras']['extras_explanation'] }}

```json
{
    "extras": {
        "extras_explanation": "For example, this sentence is actually a property in extras."
    }
}
```  
  
```md
... into pages.  
{{ '{{' }} settings['extras']['extras_explanation'] {{ '}}' }}
```

This can be useful for stuff like author names, copyright, and other data that is used in multiple places and changes often.
